# Nonograms... this is a yet unfinished project :)
So this project is currently very unhelpful if you want a good nonogram solver, or any sort of
finished nonogram solver at all.

Currently, I'm very inexperienced, so don't be surprised if I don't use proper vocabulary or I forget
to do things that might be obvious to most people, or there are bugs or mistakes in general.

I tend to write much of my documentation last or just at random times (essentially, often it's not first),
so this is why there may be places that should have comments or READMEs that are not very helpful (i.e., this README).

A quick note:
This solver is supposed to use the file format .non and the puzzle database at https://github.com/mikix/nonogram-db
by mikix. It doesn't yet support the bundles or the colored nonograms.

An uninteresting note which may become irrelevant later:
If you're wondering why there is still an ArrayList in the BruteForce class,
it's just for troubleshooting purposes at the moment. It's helpful to be able
to see all end boards without having to sift through intermediate steps.
